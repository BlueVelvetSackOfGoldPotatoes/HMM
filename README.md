# HMM
Hidden markov models and variants

Simply run "main.py" - in "main.py" the data can be changed to either a list of symbols (["A", "B", "A"]) or a string ("Alice went down the rabbit hole!"). In the case of a string, a parameter can be sent to the fitting function that determines if the HMM should learn each character's relationship (0) or whole words (1). A word for naming the output graphs is also expected as a parameter of get_graph().
